PDE2Virgo is an Eclipse plug-in that enables usage of PDE Plug-in Projects with Virgo Tools.

It is currently built against Eclipse Kepler and has been tested in Eclipse Kepler, but should
work also with Eclipse Juno.

The plug-in itself is also compatible with Eclipse Luna, but at the time of writing, 10th June 2014,
the Virgo Tools do not work with Luna making this plug-in useless.
